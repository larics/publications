  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the lane-merging strategy for self-driving cars in dense traffic using the Stackelberg game approach. From the perspective of the self-driving car, in order to make sufficient space to merge into the next lane, a self-driving car should interact with the vehicles in the next lane. In heavy traffic, where the possible actions of the vehicle are pretty limited, it is possible to conjecture the driving intentions of the vehicles from their behaviors. For example, by observing the speed changes of the human-driver in the next lane, the self-driving car can estimate its driving intention in real time, much in the same way of a human driver. We use the principle of Stackelberg competition to make the optimal decision for the self-driving car based on the predicted reaction of the interacting vehicles in the next lane. In this way, according to the traffic circumstances, a self-driving car can decide whether to merge or not. In addition, by limiting the number of interacting vehicles, the computational burden is manageable enough to be implemented in production vehicles. We verify the efficiency of the proposed method through the case studies for different test scenarios, and the test results show that our approach is closer to the human-like decision-making strategy, as compared to the conventional rule-based method.},

ABSTRACT = {This publication deals with the navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) moving in the magnetic field of two long, straight, parallel conductors, which is of high interest for several new technical applications. How the position and orientation of the UAV can be calculated using a minimal number of only three three-axis magnetometers are discussed. It is shown that the angles can be determined without the knowledge of the conductor currents and the magnetic field equations, but only by combining the sensor measurements with the rotation matrix and exploiting a characteristic property of the magnetic field. Furthermore, different strategies were investigated to determine the respective sensor positions. An analytical solution was derived from the nonlinear magnetic field equations, which promises a low computational time. It is shown that for a given sensor, several solutions exist, from which the correct one has to be selected. Therefore, a specific detection method is introduced. Once the solution is known, the UAV location can be determined. Finally, the overall algorithm was tested by simulations far from and near the conductors with superimposed typical magnetic noise.},

abstract = {This work presents a novel approach to autonomous decentralized multi-robot frontier exploration and mapping of an unknown area. A mobile robot team simultaneously explores the environment, discovers frontier points (points on the border between explored and unexplored space), and shares information in order to become dispersed throughout the environment. During the exploration, information exchanged between the mobile robots is limited to data containing mobile robot positions and current mobile robot target points. The main goal of the approach is to allocate the mobile robots to target frontier points in a way which minimizes the overall exploration time. Moreover, a mobile robot team at the same time creates a common map of the environment. The proposed strategy has been implemented in a simulation environment and compared with a state-of-the-art exploration strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed decentralized multi-robot strategy.}

ABSTRACT = {A heterogeneous robotic system that can perform various tasks in the steep vineyards of the Mediterranean region was developed and tested as part of the HEKTOR&mdash;Heterogeneous Autonomous Robotic System in Viticulture and Mariculture&mdash;project. This article describes the design of hardware and an easy-to-use method for evaluating the energy consumption of the system, as well as, indirectly, its deployment readiness level. The heterogeneous robotic system itself consisted of a flying robot&mdash;a light autonomous aerial robot (LAAR)&mdash;and a ground robot&mdash;an all-terrain mobile manipulator (ATMM), composed of an all-terrain mobile robot (ATMR) platform and a seven-degree-of-freedom (DoF) torque-controlled robotic arm. A formal approach to describe the topology and parameters of selected vineyards is presented. It is shown how Google Earth data can be used to make an initial estimation of energy consumption for a selected vineyard. On this basis, estimates of energy consumption were made for the tasks of protective spraying and bud rubbing. The experiments were conducted in two different vineyards, one with a moderate slope and the other with a much steeper slope, to evaluate the proposed estimation method.},

ABSTRACT = {Although robotic systems have found their place in agriculture, there are still many challenges, especially in the area of localization in semi-structured environments. A robotic system has been developed and tested to perform various tasks in the steep vineyards of the Mediterranean region. In this paper, we describe a method for vine trunk localization, based solely on the visual recognition of vine trunks by neural networks fed by an RGB camera. Assuming that the height of the first wire in the vineyard is known, the proposed method is used to determine the location of vines in the immediate vicinity of the all-terrain mobile manipulator&mdash;ATMM-VIV&mdash;needed for spraying and bud suckering. The experiment was conducted in a slightly inclined vineyard to evaluate the proposed localization method.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents an analysis of co-simulation defects for a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The research builds on the theorem that the co-simulation error is bounded if the co-simulation defect is bounded. The co-simulation defect can be divided into integration, output, and connection defects, all of which can be controlled. This article proves that the output and connection defect can be controlled by the co-simulation master by varying the communication step size. A non-iterative co-simulation method with variable communication step size is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the presented research. The orders of the interpolation polynomials used in the co-simulation method are varied in the experimental analysis. The experimental analysis shows how each component of a co-simulation defect affects the co-simulation error. The analysis presented is used to verify the applicability of the proposed approach and to provide guidelines for the configuration of the co-simulation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a hierarchical and game-theoretic decision-making strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). A CAV can receive preview information using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, and the optimal short- and long-term trajectory can be planned using this information. Specifically, in this study, the aggressiveness of all preceding vehicles in the car-following scenario can be estimated globally by monitoring the history of their time-series behaviors, before the CAV initiates a particular action, which is performed at the upper layer of the proposed decision-making structure. If it is determined that initiating a specific action is advantageous, the action is initiated, and the CAV then interacts with the vehicles locally to achieve its driving goal in a game-theoretical manner at the lower layer. In multiple test scenarios, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach compared to the conventional decision-making approaches, and it shows a significant improvement in terms of success rates.}

ABSTRACT = {The combined effects of environmental factors such as high winds and melting ice can cause transmission line conductors to vibrate at high amplitudes, resulting in damaged pole structures, cracked insulating strands, and short circuits. The manual installation of electrical spacers between the two power line conductors is currently the only way to prevent this, but due to the high-voltage environment, this operation is extremely dangerous for a human worker. As a solution to automate this operation, the autonomous installation of electrical spacers using a robotic manipulator is proposed. For this purpose, a design of a special end effector for the robotic installation of electrical spacers is proposed. The end effector prototype was produced and tested under laboratory conditions and then used for the autonomous installation of spacers on power lines. Its localization with respect to the power lines is based on measurements of the magnetic field generated by the alternating currents flowing through the power lines. To verify the feasibility of the proposed solution under laboratory conditions, the proposed end effector equipped with magnetometers was developed and mounted on a 6-axis Schunk LWA 4p robotic arm. The implemented autonomous installation sequence was successfully verified using a robot and a laboratory mock-up of power lines.},
